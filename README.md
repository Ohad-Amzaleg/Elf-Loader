# Custom Program Loader

## Description:
This project involves the development of a custom static program loader, adhering to the ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) specifications. The loader aims to load static executables into memory and facilitate seamless control transfer to the loaded programs.

## Features:
- **Static Loading:** Loads static executables into memory.
- **Control Transfer:** Manages transfer of control to loaded programs.
- **Virtual Memory Utilization:** Implements virtual memory concepts for process isolation and memory mapping.

## Specifications Covered:
- Understanding of ELF file specifications (Sections 2-1 to 2-9).
- Handling program headers for static program loading.
- Exploring virtual memory for process-centric memory management.

## How to Use:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Execute the loader script.
    ```
    $ ./loader <executable_name>
    ```

## Requirements:
- Basic understanding of ELF file structure and headers.
- Compiler and linker for relevant executable generation.
